# Project Overview

This repository contains three Python-based projects showcasing basic data analysis, data visualization, and API-based image generation.

## 1. Data Analysis with Pandas

This project uses the **Pandas** library to load a CSV file and perform basic data analysis tasks such as:
- Loading and displaying the dataset.
- Calculating averages for specific columns (e.g., finding the average of a price column).
- Counting unique values in categorical columns (e.g., counting unique categories).

## 2. Data Visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn

This project demonstrates how to load a dataset and create various visualizations to analyze the data using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**. The visualizations include:
- Bar plots to compare categorical data.
- Line charts to show trends over time or sequences.
- Box plots to display the distribution and variability of data.
- Scatter plots to show relationships between two numerical variables.

## 3. Text-to-Image Generator Using an API

This project utilizes an image generation API (e.g., DALL-E or Stable Diffusion) to generate images based on a given text description. The key features include:
- **Input**: A text description provided through the console (e.g., "A cat on a village house.").
- **Output**: The generated image is saved in local storage as a `.jpg` or `.png` file.
