# Project Overview

This repository contains three Python-based projects showcasing basic data analysis, data visualization, and API-based image generation.

## 1. Data Analysis with Pandas

This project uses the **Pandas** library to load a CSV file and perform basic data analysis tasks such as:
- Loading and displaying the dataset.
- Calculating averages for specific columns (e.g., finding the average of a price column).
- Counting unique values in categorical columns (e.g., counting unique categories).

## 2. Data Visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn

This project demonstrates how to load a dataset and create various visualizations to analyze the data using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**. The visualizations include:
- Bar charts to compare categorical data.
- Scatter plots to show relationships between two numerical columns.
- Heatmaps to display correlations between numerical columns.

## 3. Text-to-Image Generator Using an API

This project utilizes an image generation API (e.g., DALL-E or Stable Diffusion) to generate images based on a given text description. The key features include:
- **Input**: A text description provided through the console (e.g., "A black dog wearing a hat").
- **Output**: The generated image is saved in local storage as a `.jpg` or `.png` file.

### Usage

Each project can be run independently. Follow the instructions in the respective scripts to load datasets (for data analysis and visualization) or enter a text description (for the text-to-image generator). Ensure you have the necessary API keys and datasets available before running the scripts.

This repository demonstrates foundational skills in data handling, visualization, and interaction with external APIs.
